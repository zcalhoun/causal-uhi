# Causal UHI

This repository is used to perform experiments related to the manuscript *Estimating the effects of vegetation and increased
albedo on the urban heat island effect with spatial causal inference* [todo -- add link to this once published].

In this repository, there are:
1. Three scripts that demonstrate the cross-validation strategy, bootstrapping method, and joint training algorithm used to obtain final results.
2. Several notebooks that were used to analyze results and obtain final visualizations.
3. Dataset loaders to demonstrate pre-processing steps used in our analysis.
